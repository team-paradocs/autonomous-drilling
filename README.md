- Flash `pyserial.ino` onto Arduino  
- Make sure the right port is opened in `write_to_serial.py` node  
- colcon build the serialcomm package in a workspace  
- `ros2 run serialcomm serialwriter_exec`  
- `ros2 topic pub /drill_commands std_msgs/String "data: 'drill'" -1  `
- This turns pin 13 LED on, `'stop'` will turn it off.  
- Connec the relay inputs to pin 13, and the drill will be powered by writing to drill commands topic.  
- To integrate with manipulator, the lbr node needs to write to that topic, that's it
